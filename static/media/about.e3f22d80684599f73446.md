# Intro

Iâ€™ve spent +10 years focusing on mitigating climate change by way of efficient and strategic electrification. I hold an M.S. in Complex Systems and Data Science from the [University of Vermont Complex Systems Center](https://vermontcomplexsystems.org/) and have worked in the electric utility world for [Burlington Electric](https://www.burlingtonelectric.com/) and [Green Mountain Power](https://greenmountainpower.com). I write about ways to adopt a clean energy lifestyle and find myself talking about the importance of expanding public charging while on vacation. When it snows, you may find me at [Mad River Glen](https://www.madriverglen.com/) where I volunteer as a Ski Patroller. 

I'm particularly interested in projects with high social and climate impact. If you think I can be helpful to you or your cause and would like to meet, please feel free to get in touch.
