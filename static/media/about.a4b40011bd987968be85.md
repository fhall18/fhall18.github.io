# Intro

I am a Resource Planner at Burlington Electric, where I work on decarbonizing electricity, transportation and buildings. I recently graduated with an M.S. in Complex Systems + Data Science from [University of Vermont Complex Systems Center](https://vermontcomplexsystems.org/). Before Burlington Electric, I worked on Product Innovation with [Green Mountain Power](https://greenmountainpower.com). In my spare time, I am a volunteer ski patroller for [Mad River Glen](https://www.madriverglen.com/). I'm particularly interested in projects with high social and climate impact. If you think I can be helpful to you or your cause and would like to meet, please feel free to get in touch.
