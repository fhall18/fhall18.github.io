# Intro

I’ve spent +10 years focusing on mitigating climate change by way of efficient and strategic electrification. I hold an M.S. in Complex Systems and Data Science from the [University of Vermont Complex Systems Center](https://vermontcomplexsystems.org/) and am a Data Scientist for [EnergyHub](https://energyhub.com/). Previously, I worked in the electric utility world for [Burlington Electric](https://www.burlingtonelectric.com/) and [Green Mountain Power](https://greenmountainpower.com). I enjoy programming, data analysis, problem-solving and spending long hours looking at numbers on a screen.

My work improves how we use the clean energy. I have experience writing software to optimize grid-edge devices, devloping utility rates and managing utility-scale power supply. I’ve helped people to adopt electric vehicles and heat pumps into their homes, businesses and daily lives while powering them with renewable electricity (like [this](https://www.burlingtonelectric.com/ev/), [this](https://www.burlingtonelectric.com/heatpumps), and [this](https://www.burlingtonelectric.com/our-energy/)). I also focus on flexible load management programs that embed utility rate design to lower the cost of operating electric vehicles ([here](https://www.burlingtonelectric.com/evrate)), spur community-based peak shaving ([here](https://www.burlingtonelectric.com/peak)), and provide shared-value to customer for battery storage ([here](https://greenmountainpower.com/rebates-programs/home-energy-storage/)). My current project is to cost-effectively manage and sub-meter cold-climate heat pumps (in progress).

I'm particularly interested in projects with high climate and social impact. If you think I can be helpful to you or your cause and would like to meet, please feel free to get in touch.

# Creativity

 I write, play, and build things to stay busy. Recently I've been focusing on [persuasive posts](https://powersupply.substack.com/) aimed at dispelling the perceived barriers to adopting a clean energy lifestyle. A dose of wry humor is compulsory. I started because I kept getting questions from friends and family and realized I it was easier to send a link to a persuasive post. This has also given myself an excuse to play with data and put my daily climate-tech [feedly](https://feedly.com/i/my) scrolling to use. Playing - I'm a retired tournament chess player - retiring at the ripe old age of 12, but can be found playing pick-up games with friends and online. Building - I dabble with [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/).

# Community

When it snows, you may find me at [Mad River Glen](https://www.madriverglen.com/) where I volunteer Ski Patrol on the weekends. I joined this patrol in 2016 and consider it to lbe my second family. I'm drawn to communities where passion and altruism are commonplace, and individuals believe collective effort exceeds the sum of its parts.

# What I Read
I'm a bit addicted to Terry Pratchett...
